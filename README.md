# evanw-obsidian-templates
Obsidian (obsidian.md) is an excellent note-taking and "second brain" application, and I use it _extensively_. I'm open sourcing some of my commonly-used (and non-proprietary) templates for others to consume and remix.

## Obsidian Folder Structure
You might be wondering why the Templates folder is called `70 - Templates`. This is because I use a simple numbering system to keep everything in order (rather than alphabetically). 

If you want to copy my simple personal "Zettelkasten" structure:
- 10 - Intake
- 20 - Reference Notes
- 30 - Files
- 70 - Templates
- 80 - Archives

And here's a more complex taxonomy I use for work:
- 0 - Intake
- 1 - Working Documents
- 2 - Goals
- 3 - Teams
- 4 - People
- 5 - Operational Excellence
- 6 - Projects
- 60 - Knowledgebase (this is synonymous "Reference Notes" in my personal system, and contains the majority of my notes)
- 70 - Templates
- 80 - Archives
- 90 - Non-Indexed (I use this for interviews, files, and other things I don't want to be indexed and clog up my search. You can configure this in Settings --> Files & Links --> Excluded files.)

I think this is a great intro to Obsidian and Zettelkasten-style note-taking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ySG7xYgjY
